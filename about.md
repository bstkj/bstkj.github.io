I am a 6th-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison, under the supervision of Professor
[Cécile Ané](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~ane/).

I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in Mathematics and a
minor in Computer Science in Spring 2017, then worked for a year as a Research
Programmer for [Murphy Lab](https://murphylab.cbd.cmu.edu) in the Computational
Biology Department at Carnegie Mellon University before coming to Madison for
my Ph.D. in Fall 2018.

My research is in Statistical & Computational Phylogenetics. I am interested in
models for continuous trait evolution, and in computational techniques that
make parameter estimation for these models scalable to complex phylogenetic
networks.

My CV is available [here](/files/CV.pdf).
