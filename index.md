I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics (Spring \'25) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, under
the supervision of Professor [Cécile Ané](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~ane/).
My dissertation was on [*Statistical and Computational Techniques for Continuous Trait Models
on Phylogenetic networks*](https://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/CN7APKSRI7P2F9E).

I have a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences with a minor in Computer Science (Spring \'17) from Carnegie
Mellon University.
I worked for a year as a Research Programmer for [Murphy Lab](https://murphylab.cbd.cmu.edu)
in the Computational Biology Department at CMU before coming to Madison for my Ph.D. in Fall
2018.

My research is in Statistical & Computational Phylogenetics.
I am interested in models for continuous trait evolution, and in computational techniques
that make parameter estimation for these models scalable to complex phylogenetic networks.

My CV is available [here](/files/cv.pdf).
