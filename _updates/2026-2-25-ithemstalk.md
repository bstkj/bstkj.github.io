I gave another talk on adapting cluster graphs to fit continuous trait models on phylogenetic networks at the biology seminar of the RIKEN Center for Interdisciplinary Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences (iTHEMS) in Wako, Saitama.

Incidentally, おふろの王様 provides an excellent onsen 10min walk from RIKEN :)
