I recently gave a talk on adapting cluster graphs to fit continuous trait models on phylogenetic networks in the Department of Statistics at the National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan.
The faculty were very welcoming, and I look forward to keeping in contact and finding opportunities to collaborate!
